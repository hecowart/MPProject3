                        <p>Although Utah is in the top 10 states for reported human trafficking cases, the state does not have programs to help survivors of trafficking get back on their feet, according to Petey McKnight. The Aspen House organization, for which McKnight serves as chairwoman of the board, was created to address this issue.</p>
                        <p>Aspen House, which is designed to mirror 57 other homes across the country, will provide a home for people recovering from trafficking situations.</p>
                        <p>Aspen House will house between eight and 12 women for two years while they work toward recovery. McKnight said 75% of graduates for programs like this around the county are back on their feet after the two years. She said there is a “huge need” for this in Salt Lake City, because survivors in the state do not have a lot of resources available to them.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Surviving human trafficking</h2>
                        <p>Garcia and her sister, Brandi Funk, were both being victimized at the same time, each in their early 30s. Both met a different man who they thought loved and cared for them but who was actually “grooming” them so that they could be trafficked. Even when they became aware of it, they were not able to get out of their situations until they separately got arrested and sought help.</p>
                        <p>The men were able to keep the women from going to police by getting them addicted to drugs, Garcia explained. She was addicted to heroin, and her trafficker used that as leverage so that she would keep working for him. Although Garcia got arrested for prostitution multiple times, she did not seek help until she had been trafficked for two years.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Human trafficking is an open wound on the body of contemporary society, a scourge upon the body of Christ. It is a crime against humanity.” </blockquote>
                        <p>“You feel disgusting, you feel filthy, you feel like you’re worth nothing. And then you get physically dependent on a drug that they’re offering you. ... Every day is hell, every day of your life is hell when you’re stuck in trafficking,” Funk said.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Aspen House can help</h2>
                        <p>The Aspen House, McKnight said, will help others find the camaraderie that Funk used to help her get out by connecting survivors with others who have been able to get out of their situations and become confident again.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">It can be hard at times to help others, but those who hurt are in need.</span>
                        <p>McKnight said they have raised about $75,000 for the project and have a goal of raising $2 million. If they are able to reach that goal, they will be able to purchase a home and fund the program for the next few years.</p>
                        <p>“You took a leap of faith to start Aspen House and begin its story. Its walls will harbor safely so many other stories of those survivors who call Aspen House home, women whose lives will be forever changed because of a belief that stories can be changed, lives can have hope and dignity and respect,” Bryant said.</p>
